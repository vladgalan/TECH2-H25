    "# Exercise 1: Plotting functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following function in one variable $x$, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\sin(20 x) + 5 x^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "which is the sum of the sine function and a quadratic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Define a Python function that returns the function value $f(x)$ for some \n",
    "    argument $x$. The function should work with both scalar numbers and \n",
    "    NumPy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Hint:* The sine function is implemented in \n",
    "    [`np.sin()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sin.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Evaluate the function on a uniformly spaced grid of $x$-values\n",
    "    on the interval $[-1, 1]$ using 51 grid points.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a plot depicting the function on this interval. Set the\n",
    "    $x$-ticks to the values $[-1, 0, 1]$ and add a legend.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Locate the point $x_{min}$ where the function attains its minimum on the grid \n",
    "    you created and print the values $(x_{min}, f(x_{min}))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Hint:* You can use the NumPy function \n",
    "    [`np.argmin()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.argmin.html) for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Augment the plot you created earlier with a horizontal and vertical\n",
    "    line indicating where the minimum is located. Add a black dot at the point $(x_{min}, f(x_{min}))$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    Familiarize yourself with the data by printing the columns present in the data set and the first 5 rows of data.\n",

    "    *Hint:* This can be achieved using the \n",
    "    [`pct_change()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pct_change.html) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Create a figure with two subplots (arranged in 2 rows) which show the GDP growth and the unemployment rate.\n",

    "    `peak` column) until GDP started growing again (stored in the `trough` column). \n",

    "    1.  Load the business cycle dates from `NBER_cycle_dates.csv` located in the `data/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "        Drop all rows where the `peak` date starts before 1948.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    2.  Loop through all remaining business cycle peak dates and add a vertical line to\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  Load the CSV data and restrict the sample to the calendar year 2024. \n",

    "    *Hint:* The data is tab-separated, so you need to specify `sep='\\t'` when reading in the data.\n",

    "    a separate row. For the following analysis, the data needs to be reshaped such that each \n",
    "    ticker symbol is in its own column (\"wide\" format).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use the [`pivot()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pivot.html)\n",

    "    [`pct_change()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pct_change.html)), \n",
