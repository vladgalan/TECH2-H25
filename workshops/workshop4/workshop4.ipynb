    "For this exercise, we're using data on around 3,000 observations of house prices and house characteristics from Ames, a small city in Iowa.\n",

    "1.  Load the Ames housing data set from `ames_houses.csv` located in the `data/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To familiarize yourself with the data, report the columns present in the DataFrame and \n",

    "    Check that there are no observations with missing values in the final data set.\n",

    "2.  Compute the average house price (column `SalePrice`) by neighborhood (column `Neighborhood`). List the three most expensive neighborhoods, for example by using [`sort_values()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "For this exercise, we're using data on around 3,000 observations of house prices and house characteristics from Ames, a small city in Iowa,\n",

    "\n",
    "2.  Compute the average year in which a house was built (using the column `YearBuilt`). \n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a new column `New` which takes on the value of 1 if the house was built \n",
    "    after the average year of construction in the sample (_\"new\"_), and 0 otherwise (_\"old\"_). \n",
    "\n",
    "    What is the average year of construction within these two categories?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Create a new column `Rooms` which categorizes the number of `Bedrooms` into three groups: 1, 2, and 3 or more. You can create these categories using boolean indexing, [`np.where()`](https://numpy.org/doc/2.0/reference/generated/numpy.where.html), pandas's [`where()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.where.html), or some other way.\n",

    "2.  The column `CPI` stores the consumer price index (CPI) for the US. You may be more familiar with the concept of inflation, which is the percent change of the CPI relative to the previous period. \n",
    "    Create a new column `Inflation` which contains the _annual_ inflation _in percent_ relative to the same month in the previous year by applying \n",
    "    [`pct_change()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pct_change.html) to the column `CPI`.\n",

    "    -   Since this is monthly data, you need to pass the argument `periods=12` to `pct_change()` to get annual percent changes.\n",

    "\n",
    "3.  Compute the average unemployment rate (column `UNRATE`) over the whole sample period. Create a new column `UNRATE_HIGH` that contains an indicator whenever the unemployment rate is above its average value (_\"high unemployment period\"_). \n",
