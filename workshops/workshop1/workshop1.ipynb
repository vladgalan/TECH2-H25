    "# Exercise 1: Summing lists and arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we investigate another difference between built-in lists and NumPy arrays: performance.\n",
    "We do this by comparing the execution time of different implementations of the `sum()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a list `lst` and a NumPy array `arr`, each of them containing the sequence \n",
    "   of ten values `0, 1, 2, ..., 9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Hint*: You can use the list constructor [`list()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_list.asp)\n",
    "   and combine it with the [`range()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-range)\n",
    "   function which returns an objecting representing a range of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Hint:* You should create the NumPy array using \n",
    "   [`np.arange()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We want to compute the sum of integers contained in `lst` and `arr`. Use \n",
    "   the built-in function [`sum()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_sum.asp)\n",
    "   to sum elements of a list.\n",
    "   For the NumPy array, use the NumPy function \n",
    "   [`np.sum()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You are interested in benchmarking which summing function is faster.\n",
    "    Repeat the steps from above, but use the cell magic \n",
    "    [`%timeit`](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-timeit)\n",
    "    to time the execution of a statement as follows:\n",

    "    ```python\n",
    "    %timeit statement\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Recreate the list and array to contain 100 integers starting from 0,\n",
    "    and rerun the benchmark.\n",

    "    2.  Use the parameters $A = 1$, $B=2$, and $C=10$.\n",
    "    3.  Define the variable `u_max = -np.inf` (negative infinity).\n",
    "    4.  Loop through all candidate consumption levels, and compute the associated utility. If this utility is larger than the previous maximum value `u_max`, update `u_max` and store the associated consumption level `cons_max`.\n",

    "    3. Use the index returned by `np.argmax()` to retrieve the maximum utility and the \n",
