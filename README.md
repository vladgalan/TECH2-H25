## Guides

See the [guides/](guides/README.md) folder for instructions on how to 
install Anaconda (Python), Visual Studio Code, and git version control.


## Forking & Cloning

### Forking

- Click on the `Fork` icon to fork this repository (create your own personal copy)
- In the future, you need to click on `Sync Fork` to get new commits made to this repository into your forked version.

### Cloning

1. Click on the green `Code` icon to clone the repository to your computer
2. Select HTTPS or SSH depending on your authentication method (SSH keys will only work if you have configured them) and copy the URL.
3. You can clone the repository directly in Visual Studio Code, or use the command line:

    _Using HTTPS (no SSH key configured):_
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/richardfoltyn/TECH2-H25.git
    ```
    _Using SSH keys:_
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:richardfoltyn/TECH2-H25.git
    ```


## Creating a Conda environment

Using the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), you can use 
the environment definition file ([environment.yml](environment.yml)) provided in this repository to create 
a conda environment called `TECH2`:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Note that you first need to change to the directly where `environment.yml` is located for this to work.
