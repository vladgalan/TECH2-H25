    "# Introduction to pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have encountered built-in Python containers (`list`, `tuple`, `dict`) \n",
    "and NumPy arrays as the only way to store data.\n",
    "However, while NumPy arrays are great for storing *homogenous* data\n",
    "without any particular structure, they are somewhat limited when\n",
    "we want to use them for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we usually want to process data sets with\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  several variables;\n",
    "2.  multiple observations, which need not be identical across\n",
    "    variables (some values may be missing);\n",
    "3.  non-homogenous data types: for examples,\n",
    "    names need to be stored as strings, birthdays as dates and income as\n",
    "    a floating-point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "While NumPy can in principle handle such situations, it puts all the\n",
    "burden on the user. Most users would prefer to not have to deal\n",
    "with such low-level details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas was created to offer more versatile data structures that are\n",
    "straightforward to use for storing, manipulating and analyzing\n",
    "heterogeneous data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Data is organized in *variables* and *observations*, similar\n",
    "    to econometrics programs such as Stata, or R using `data.frame` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Each variable is permitted to have a *different* data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  We can use *labels* to select observations instead of having to use\n",
    "    a linear numerical index as with NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We could, for example, index a data set using National Insurance Numbers\n",
    "    or time stamps for time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Pandas offers many convenient data aggregation and reduction\n",
    "    routines that can be applied to subsets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, we can easily group observations by city and compute average\n",
    "    incomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Pandas also offers many convenient data import / export functions that\n",
    "    go beyond what's in NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should we be using pandas at all times, then? No!\n",
    "\n",
    "-   For low-level tasks where performance is essential, use NumPy.\n",
    "-   For homogenous data without any particular data structure, use NumPy.\n",
    "-   On the other hand, if data is heterogeneous, needs to be imported from\n",
    "    an external data source and cleaned or transformed before\n",
    "    performing computations, use pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous tutorials on pandas on the internet.\n",
    "Useful additional material includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The official [user guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html).\n",
    "-   The official [pandas cheat sheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)\n",
    "    which nicely illustrates the most frequently used operations.\n",
    "-   The official [API reference](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html) with details on\n",
    "    every pandas object and function.\n",
    "-   There are numerous tutorials (including videos) available\n",
    "    on the internet. See [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/tutorials.html)\n",
    "    for a list."

    "## Creating pandas data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has two main data structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  [`Series`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/series.html) \n",
    "    represents observations of a *single* variable.\n",
    "2.  [`DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/frame.html) \n",
    "    is a container for *several* variables. You can think\n",
    "    of each individual column of a `DataFrame` as a `Series`,\n",
    "    and each row represents one observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to create a `Series` or `DataFrame` is to create\n",
    "them from pre-existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access pandas data structures and routines, we need to import them first.\n",
    "The near-universal convention is to make pandas available using the name `pd`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
